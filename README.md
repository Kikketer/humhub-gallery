# Gallery 

Enhance your Spaces and profiles with galleries. Collect and categorize all important images and never lose track of them again.

## Overview

- Create as many subgalleries as you need
- Upload images with drag & drop
- Include descriptions
- Open galleries directly from the stream or jump from a single picture to the original post
- Include your favorite images in an animated widget
- Define who is allowed to manage them (add, delete, modify)
- Add personal galleries to your own profile
- And, of course, discuss and show your appreciation

## Development

**Setup**

Grunt is only used to build the stylesheets, if you don't plan on updating the styles you don't need to do these steps.

1. Check out the project
2. Run `npm install` to have Grunt ready

**Edit and Build Styles**

To update the css documents, edit the `resources/css/gallery.less` file.  Then run `npm run build`.
